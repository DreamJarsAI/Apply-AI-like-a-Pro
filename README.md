# Apply AI like a Pro

I’m Ruopeng An, a professor at New York University. I created this repo to store and share the Google Colab files (.ipynb) I wrote for my YouTube channel, “[Apply AI like a Pro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwd5_sW0vb5J38ShMVs0VQ)”.

Trained as a social scientist with little programming experience, I know the barriers for a non-technical person to learn AI: monster math equations in textbooks, lines after lines of code with little explanation, broken or half-finished code in online tutorials that never runs, the daunting gap from textbook toy examples to real-world applications…

I created the YouTube channel to precisely address those barriers. Each video is a complete, self-contained project that applies AI (machine or deep learning) to solve a practical, real-world problem. Unique features include: 
* Use customized, real-world datasets instead of preloaded, toy datasets
* Hands-on, step-by-step applications of state-of-the-art AI models
* Thorough explanations of each line of code in the video
* Detailed annotations for each line of code in the file
* The file containing all code can be downloaded and run in Google Colab instantly, error-free
* The file serves as a reusable template for similar applications

You are warmly invited to subscribe to my YouTube channel, “[Apply AI like a Pro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwd5_sW0vb5J38ShMVs0VQ)”, so that you can get new videos weekly and follow them along with the code stored in this repo. Happy learning!
